            <p>I've always been interested in anything art and computer<br>
                related. After studying Computer Science for two years, <br>
                I graduated from University of Texas at San Antonio with a <br>
                BA in Art. I soon decided that wasn't enough for me and less <br>
                than a year later I enrolled at Sam Houston State University <br>
                and graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design in 2022. Throughout <br>
                my time, I've learned that creativity allows us to be open-minded <br>
                and solve problems. My skills and personality have brought me <br>
                success, but I've always been interested in trying new things.<br>
                <br>
                Since graduating, I've designed logos for a few local companies. <br>
                I've also worked a Graphic Designer for Red Table Talk and <br>
                Marketing Specialist for the Houston Food Bank. These <br>
                opportunities have allowed me to approach a variety of projects <br>
                and concepts with versatility and adaptability.<br>
                <br>
                Creating is what I live for.
